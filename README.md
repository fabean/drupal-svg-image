# SVG images using files
 "Borrowed" from an answer to this [question]
 (http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/98216/adding-svg-file-extension-drupal-gets-stuck)

# HOWTO
1. install & enable module as you normally would.
2. Create "image" field but use a file field instead.
3. Under settings only let file extension of `.svg` be used.
4. Under display settings change the formatter as image.
5. Profit.
